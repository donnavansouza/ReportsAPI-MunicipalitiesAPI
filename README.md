This repository contains two FastAPI applications:

1. **Reports API**: Manages reports data.
2. **Municipalities API**: Provides municipality data from a JSON file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Docker (optional, for containerized setup)
- PostgreSQL (for Reports API database)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Configure the database (for Reports API):

    Update the `database.py` file with your PostgreSQL connection details.

## Running the Applications

### With Docker

1. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine.
2. Build and run the Docker containers:

    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

This will start both APIs on the following addresses:

- Reports API: `http://localhost:5000`

- Municipalities API: `http://localhost:8000`

### Without Docker

#### Running the Municipalities API

1. Navigate to the `municipalities_api` directory:

    ```sh
    cd municipalities_api
    ```

2. Start the application:

    ```sh
    uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```

#### Running the Reports API

1. Navigate to the `reports_api` directory:

    ```sh
    cd reports_api
    ```

2. Start the application:

    ```sh
    uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
    ```

Ensure that the Municipalities API is running before starting the Reports API since it depends on it for initial data loading.
